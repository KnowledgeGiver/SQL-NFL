# The NFL
This assignment will give you more practice with queries, and get you to deal with some more advanced parts of the sql language.

## Setup 
- Fork and clone this repo.
- Go inside the folder you just cloned
- In your terminal run the command **`psql -f seed.sql`**
- You should see something like this
```sh
 > $: psql -f seed.sql 
psql:seed.sql:1: NOTICE:  database "nfl" does not exist, skipping
DROP DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE
You are now connected to database "nfl" as user "thiagocavalcante".
psql:seed.sql:7: NOTICE:  table "players" does not exist, skipping
DROP TABLE
psql:seed.sql:8: NOTICE:  table "teams" does not exist, skipping
DROP TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 32
INSERT 0 1532
```
- Now that your database was created and seeded go ahead and open **pgAdmin** and you will find a database named **nfl**

### Exercise
Open vsCode and select the file [nfl.sql](nfl.sql). On this file is where you will submit your queries for each prompt. Few free to write your queries using the **pgAdmin**, but make sure to copy and paste the final queries into the nfl.sql file. :wink:
