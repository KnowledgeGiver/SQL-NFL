# The NFL
This assignment will give you more practice with queries, and get you to deal with some more advanced parts of the sql language.

## Setup 
- Open up your `psql`
- Copy and paste the commands 1 by 1 in the seed.sql file _Note:_ Some of the commands are pretty long.

- Now that your database was created and seeded complete the prompts below

### Exercise
Open vsCode and select the file [nfl.sql](nfl.sql). On this file is where you will submit your queries for each prompt. Few free to write your queries using the **pgAdmin**, but make sure to copy and paste the final queries into the nfl.sql file. :wink:
